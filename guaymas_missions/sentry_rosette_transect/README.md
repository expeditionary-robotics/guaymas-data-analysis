# AUV Sentry and Rosette Transect
At the conclusion of cruise RR2107, a transect starting approximately 18km south of a known hydrothermally active ridge and crossing over that ridge was conducted with both AUV Sentry and a towed CTD Rosette. AUV Sentry was flown in altitude-hold mode for the transect, at approximately 1700-1725m depth. The Rosette was towed to target approximately 1650m depth. Each platform carried unique sensing equipment:
* AUV Sentry
  * NOPP methane instrument (experimental)
  * Optode
  * Oxidation reduction potential (ORP) probe
  * Optical Backscatter (OBS) instrument
  * Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) probe
* CTD Rosette
  * SAGE methane instrument (experimental)
  * Optode
  * Transmissometer
  * CTD probe
  * Niskin Bottles (sampled *ex situ* by Los Gatos Research Dissolved Gas Extraction Unit and Greenhouse Gas Analyzer, as well as laboratory analyzed samples of ammonium, nitrate, and nitrite)
