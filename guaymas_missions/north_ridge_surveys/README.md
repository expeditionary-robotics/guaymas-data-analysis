# AUV Sentry Surveys at the Northern Ridge
During RR2107, AUV Sentry was used to perform several surveys in the Northern Guaymas Basin at an active hydrothermal ridge. These transects were designed by scientists onboard, and a algorithm which attempted to optimize the number if in situ samples over the course of a survey.

AUV Sentry carried the following sensing equipment:
* Pythia methane instrument (experimental)
* SAGE methane instrument (experimental)
* Optode
* Oxidation reduction potential (ORP) probe
* Optical Backscatter (OBS) instrument
* Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) probe
* Niskin bottle sampler
  
This subdirectory contains scripts used to generate advanced data products (which will populate in `.\data` and `.\output` folders and will be used in assessing the capability of the algorithmic agent) in addition to various visualizations.
